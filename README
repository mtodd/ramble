Solving the shortage of Merb-based blog engines!


== Introduction

This is essentially an experimentation with Merb; this previous statement can be
read (and base the validity of many assumptions) that it will be very simple and
that it will probably suck.


== Installation

This code was based off of Merb 0.9.3, so it may break before version 1.0.

Dependencies:

* Merb (>= 0.9.3)
* Sequel (>= 1.5.1)
* MySQL (or PostgreSQL)

Once these dependencies are satisfied and migrations have been run, you should
be fine to run the server.
