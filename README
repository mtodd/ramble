Solving the shortage of Merb-based blog engines!


== Introduction

This is essentially an experimentation with Merb; this previous statement can be
read (and base the validity of many assumptions) that it will be very simple and
that it will probably suck.


== Installation

This code was based off of Merb 0.9.3, so it may break before version 1.0.

Dependencies:

* Merb (>= 0.9.3)
* Sequel (>= 1.5.1)
* MySQL (or PostgreSQL)

Once these dependencies are satisfied and migrations have been run, you should
be fine to run the server.

To start creating posts, run the following:

$ merb -i
>> u = User.create(:username => 'test', :email => 'test')
>> u.cleartext_password = "password"
>> u.save

This will be your username and password to begin authoring posts as.

To set up comments with Disqus (currently the only way to have comments), edit
the file in config/disqus.yml (copy from config/disqus.yml.sample) and set it to
your custom Disqus website address account.
